# HumanMove

This project is for human movement analysis in video scenes, such as detecting crowd gatherings and generating heatmaps.

## Features
- Download videos from YouTube for analysis
- (Planned) Detect and visualize crowd gatherings using heatmaps

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python get_video.py
